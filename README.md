So start of chapter 1

Chapter 1 does not have anything of much significance (to me). I have been working with Javascript for more than 2 years now, so it is some really basic stuff.

Welcome to chapter 1 keypoints

=> React is a library developed by Facebook and released in 2013
=> React emphasizes functional programming over object oriented programming
=> React developer tool (Really helpful)
=> Node.js is a runtime environment for javascript to run full-stack javascript applications. React does not run on node.js but we need node.js for installing packages with 'npm'
=> Yarn is better (Dont really care about it. Both are package managers)


Aaand that the summary of chapter 1
Pretty disappointing ;)
Looking forward to chapter 2
