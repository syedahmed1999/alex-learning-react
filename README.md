Starting chapter 2 now

Excited? Well, I am.
I deleted the react app folder because we will not be needing it in this chapter. 

Emerging Javascript.... Wooooooooooo

=> What is ECMA? We always hear ES6 or ECMAScript2015. But what is ECMA and what does this entity do? ECMA is a commitee that is incharge of all the changes or updates that is to be done in Javascript.

=> Const vs Let vs Var? Well, before the ES6 there was only `var` and it has a global scope. We can not implement it inside a block and expect it not change the value globally. For examples, see problem 1-2

=> A `const` is a variable type that cannot be changed. And it must always be initialized. 

=> A `let` is a variable type that inhibits the lexical scoping. It has access only in the specific block that initilizes it. See difference in problem-3

=> New to write strings. Yayyy. Template string. using `` instead of ''. This allows us to make better template of emails etc because we do not need to use the + sign anymore. See problem-4

=> we can set the default params in the function. in this case if there is not param passed when the function is called then the it gets assigned to the default value

=> Arrow functions: Everyone knows that one of the biggest update of the ES6 was the arrow function. 

=> What is transpiling? Well its kind of like compiling but NOT. Not every browser can understand or keep up with the updates of Javascript. So we use a transpiler like 'Bable' to transform the code into (not machine code like compiler) ES5 code. This way every browser can understand it
